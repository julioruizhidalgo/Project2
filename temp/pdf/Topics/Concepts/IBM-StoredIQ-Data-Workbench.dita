        companies to realize that big data is problematic, but it is hard to identify what problems
        they have. Big data is all about the unknown, but the unknown cannot be off limits. IBM
        StoredIQ Data Workbench can help you learn about your data, make educated decisions with
        your most valuable asset, and turn your company's most dangerous risk into its most valuable
        asset.</shortdesc>

            to actively manage your company's data. It helps you to determine how much data you
            have, where it is, who owns it, and when it was last used. When you have a clear
            understanding of your company's data landscape, IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench helps you
            take control of data. You can make informed decisions about your data and act on that
            knowledge by copying, copying to retention, or conducting a discovery export. </p>

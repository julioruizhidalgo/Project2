        <p> IBM StoredIQ Administrator provides at-a-glance understanding of the different issues
            that can crop up in the IBM StoredIQ environment. These views are unique to the IBM
            StoredIQ Administrator application as they provide an overview of how the system is
            running. They allow access to various pieces of information that are being shared across
            applications or allow for the management of resources in a centralized manner. </p>
        <p> The administrator is the person responsible for managing the IBM StoredIQ. This
            individual has strong understanding of data sources, indexes, data servers, jobs,
            infosets, and actions. This list provides an overview as to how IBM StoredIQ
            Administrator works: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Viewing data servers and volumes</b>: Using IBM StoredIQ Administrator, the
                    Administrator can identify what data servers are deployed, their location, what
                    data is being managed, and the status of each data server in the system. Volume
                    management is a central component of IBM StoredIQ. IBM StoredIQ Administrator
                    also allows the Administrator to see what volumes are currently under
                    management, which data server is responsible for that volume, the state of the
                    volume after indexing, and the amount and size of information that is contained
                    by each volume. Administrators can also add volumes to and delete volumes from
                    data servers through this interface. </p>
                <p>If IBM StoredIQ is configured for integration with Information Governance
                    Catalog, the Administrator can also manage which volumes are published to the
                    governance catalog.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Scheduling harvests:</b> Harvesting, which can also be referred to as indexing,
                is the process or task by which IBM StoredIQ examines and classifies data in your
                network. Using IBM StoredIQ Administrator, harvests can be scheduled, edited, and
                deleted. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Creating system infosets:</b> System infosets that use only specific indexed
                volumes can be created and managed within IBM StoredIQ Administrator. Although
                infosets are a core component of IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench, system infosets are
                created as a shortcut for users in IBM StoredIQ Administrator. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Managing users:</b> The user management area allows administrators to create
                users and manage users' access to the various IBM StoredIQ applications. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Configuring and managing actions:</b> An action is any process that is taken upon
                the data that is represented by the indexes. Actions are run by data servers on
                indexed data objects. Any errors or warnings that are generated as a result of an
                action are recorded as exceptions in IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench. <note> Actions can
                    be created within IBM StoredIQ Administrator and then made available to other
                    IBM StoredIQ applications such as IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench. </note>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Managing target sets:</b> Provides an interface that allows the user to set the
                wanted targets for specific actions that require a destination volume for their
                actions. </li>
            <li><b> Reports:</b> IBM StoredIQ Administrator provides a number of built-in reports,
                such as summaries of data objects in the system, storage use, and the number of
                identical documents in the system. You can create custom reports, including Query
                Analysis Reports for e-discovery purposes, and automatically email report
                notifications to administrators and other interested parties. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Auto-classification:</b> Automated document categorization, what IBM StoredIQ
                refers to as auto- classification models, integrates the IBMÂ® Content
                Classification's classification model into the IBM StoredIQ infoset-generation
                process. Data Experts can use IBM Content Classification to train a classification
                model, which is then registered with IBM StoredIQ Administrator. The registered
                classification model can be applied to an existing infoset in IBM StoredIQ Data
                Workbench to generate new metadata for the objects in the infoset. Metadata can be
                used in rule-based filters to create new infosets. </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Cartridges:</b> Cartridges are compressed files that contain analysis logic.
                    When you add a cartridge to IBM StoredIQ AppStack, it can detect new data in
                    documents during indexing and make these new insights searchable. For example, a
                    sensitive pattern cartridge can enable IBM StoredIQ to detect passport numbers,
                    phone numbers, and other IDs. </p>
                <p> To apply the analysis logic contained in the cartridge, you must run a Step-up
                    Analytics action that uses the cartridge on an infoset. IBM StoredIQ examines
                    all documents in the infoset, applies the analytics, and then stores the
                    analysis results in the IBM StoredIQ index. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Managing concepts: </b>Provides the ability to relate business concepts to
                indexed data. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Managing Mule scripts:</b> Helps you to create Mule scripts and upload script
                packages. These Mule scripts are used by IBM StoredIQ Policy Manager to create
                policies using the automation workflow. </li>
            <li>
                <b>DataServer - Classic:</b> Data servers can be categorized in two types:
                DataServer - Classic and DataServer - Distributed. DataServer - Classic refers to
                the regular data servers. It uses either the current PostgreSQL or Lucene index as
                an index. </li>
            <li>
                <b>DataServer - Distributed:</b> The distributed data server uses an Elasticsearch
                cluster instead of an embedded Postgres database. It increases the scalability and
                flexibility of the IBM StoredIQ deployment in a way that it can manage much larger
                amounts of data. Without adding more data servers, data that is managed by the IBM
                StoredIQ deployment can be increased by adding new nodes to the Elasticsearch
                cluster. Search queries perform better on DataServer - Distributed. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Connector API SDK:</b> A connector is a software component of IBM StoredIQ that
                is used to connect to a data source such as a network file system and access its
                data. Using IBM StoredIQ Connector API SDK, developers of other companies can
                develop connectors to new data sources outside the IBM StoredIQ development
                environment. These connectors can be integrated with a live IBM StoredIQ application
                to index, search, manage, and analyze data on the data source. </li>
        </ul>
